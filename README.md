## EX3

### Description

The EX3 assembly code performs the following tasks:

1.  Prompts the user to enter a string.
2.  Reads the input string.
3.  Removes newline characters from the input.
4.  Determines the length of the input string.
5.  Prints the input string in a staggered form.

### Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1.  Enter a string when prompted.
2.  The code will remove newline characters, determine the length of the string, and print the string in a staggered form.
3.  The program will exit after completing these tasks.

## EX4

### Description

The EX4 assembly code processes pairs of base 8 digits separated by '$' and performs the following tasks:

1.  Prompts the user to enter pairs of base 8 digits separated by '$'.
2.  Reads the input string.
3.  Validates the input to ensure it consists of valid pairs.
4.  Converts the valid pairs to decimal.
5.  Prints the converted decimal values.
6.  Sorts the decimal values in ascending order.
7.  Prints the sorted decimal values.

### Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1.  Enter pairs of base 8 digits separated by '$' when prompted.
2.  The code will validate the input, convert it to decimal, and print the converted decimal values.
3.  It will then sort the decimal values and print the sorted values.
4.  The program will exit after completing these tasks.
